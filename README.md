# spoti-cve
> FrontEnd network vulnerability reporting tool. 
This repo hosts the assets used to build the Spoti-cve website, available at .


### Demo 
A live demo can be found here [here](https://honey20103.github.io/spoti-cve/)


## Project Setup

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/Honey20103/spoti-cve.git
```
### Skeleton

## Project Goals

- This serves as a web front or Dashboard for a vulnerability reporting tool 
- The tool is expected to provide daily reports on the most recent CVE vulnerabilities released.
- The info regarding CVE's is collected based on the Spotify inventory of network devices and software versions installed.
- The web front is aimed to provide observability and visibility within the ENT squad and any other team in Spotify.
- The website collects and displays data collected and generated by the cve_reporting_tool, a Python3 script.
- Network Engineers in the ENT squad will be able to view the website, keep track of and be alerted on ulnerabilities applicable to different platforms simultaneously
- Network Engineers in the ENT squad will be able to use the context and data on the website to make better decisions regarding vendors used or protocols used.
- Other engineers across spotify specifically the Security Engineers will be able to view our vulnerabilities on this platform
- In the future this project could be a great opportunity for cross-squad collaboration with other squads within Spotify, might be able to include their inventory and track their CVE's too. And thus will have ability to input request for collaboration via the website.

## Future Features

- Possibly have alerts to communication platforms such like Slack.
- Possibly include and track 0 day vulnerabilities on our inventory. 

## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap 

## Testing
This site was manually tested through trial and error to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.

- Encountered many issues with regards to overflow of the the x-axis, couldn't seem to fix that for mobile devices.
- Other issues found challenging to was the responsiveness nd creating media queries that would suit any device.
- Lastly the table was challenging as i had to try different bootsrap options to fit it on one screen, however i didnt manage to solve for it to be compact and neat for small or mbile devices.


## Deployment 
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch.
